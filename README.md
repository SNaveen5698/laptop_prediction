Title:
"Laptop Price Prediction: Unveiling Insights with XGBoost"

Summary:
This Python script uses XGBoost and MinMaxScaler to predict laptop prices based on various features. It includes data preprocessing, model creation, evaluation, predictions for lesser-known brands, visualization of average prices by brand, and limitations of the model. Additionally, it demonstrates predicting prices for a new laptop and visualizing top brands by total sales.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the laptop dataset, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables.
Model Creation: Developed an XGBoost regression model within a pipeline using MinMaxScaler for feature scaling.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2) Score metrics.
Predictions for Lesser-Known Brands: Made predictions for laptops from lesser-known brands and evaluated their performance.
Visualization: Plotted a bar chart showing the average prices by brand and a bar chart for top brands by total sales.
New Laptop Price Prediction: Demonstrated predicting the price for a new laptop using the trained model.
Achievements:

Developed a robust XGBoost regression model for accurate price predictions.
Identified average prices by brand and top-selling brands based on total sales.
Successfully predicted prices for laptops from lesser-known brands and a new laptop based on its features.
